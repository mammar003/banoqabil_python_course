 PURPOSE:
The purpose of this project is to create a user-friendly currency converter application with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Python. The application allows users to convert currencies between different countries based on the latest exchange rates fetched from a website. This currency converter is particularly useful for individuals or businesses that need to frequently convert currencies for financial transactions or planning purposes.

 FUNCTIONALITY:

GUI Interface: The application provides a simple and intuitive interface using Tkinter, a standard GUI toolkit for Python.

Currency Selection: Users can select the currency they want to convert from and to using dropdown menus.

Amount Input: Users can input the amount they wish to convert.

Conversion: Upon clicking the "Convert" button, the application fetches the latest exchange rates from a website, performs the currency conversion, and displays the converted amount.

Error Handling: The application handles various errors gracefully, such as invalid input or failure to fetch exchange rates.

 Usage Instructions:

Launch the Application: Run the Python script containing the currency converter code.

Interface: The application window will appear with the following elements:
• Dropdown menus to select the currency to convert from and to.
• An entry field to input the amount.
• A "Convert" button to initiate the conversion process.

Select Currencies: Use the dropdown menus to select the currencies you want to convert from and to. The default currencies are USD and EUR.

Input Amount: Enter the amount you wish to convert into the entry field.

Perform Conversion: Click the "Convert" button to perform the currency conversion.

View Result: The converted amount will be displayed in a popup window.

Error Handling: If there are any errors, such as invalid input or failure to fetch exchange rates, error messages will be displayed to alert the user.
